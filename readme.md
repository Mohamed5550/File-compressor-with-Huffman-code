# Huffman code compressor

this prroject is an application of Huffman code

I've used huffman code algorithm to generate codes for encoding and decoding the file to save 20%-90% of the original file sizes

There are additional 3 files besides the code, they are testing files

- original: the original lorem ipsum text
- compressed: the compressed file which was generated with the code
- decompressed: the original text again but decoded from the compressed file
